        A car, or an automobile, is a
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motor_vehicle">motor vehicle</a>
        with wheels. Most definitions of cars state that they run primarily on
        roads, seat one to eight people, have four wheels, and mainly transport
        people, not cargo.<sup><sup>[1]</sup><sup>[2]</sup></sup> French
        inventor Nicolas-Joseph Cugnot built the first steam-powered road
        vehicle in 1769, while French-born Swiss inventor François Isaac de
        Rivaz designed and constructed the first internal combustion-powered
        automobile in 1808.

        The modern car—a practical, marketable automobile for everyday use—was
        invented in 1886, when German inventor Carl Benz patented his Benz
        Patent-Motorwagen. Commercial cars became widely available during the
        20th century. One of the first cars affordable by the masses was the
        1908 Model T, an American car manufactured by the Ford Motor Company.
        Cars were rapidly adopted in the US, where they replaced horse-drawn
        carriages.<sup>[3]</sup> In Europe and other parts of the world, demand
        for automobiles did not increase until after World War II.<sup>[4]</sup>
        The car is considered an essential part of the developed economy.

                Ferdinand Verbiest, a member of a Jesuit mission in China, built
                a steam-powered vehicle around 1672 as a toy for the Kangxi
                Emperor. It was small-scale and could not carry a driver, but it
                was, perhaps, the first working steam-powered vehicle
                ('auto-mobile').<sup>[1]</sup><sup>[10]</sup> Steam-powered
                self-propelled vehicles large enough to transport people and
                cargo were devised in the late 18th century. Nicolas-Joseph
                Cugnot demonstrated his fardier à vapeur ("steam dray"), an
                experimental steam-driven artillery tractor, in 1770 and 1771.
                Cugnot's design proved impractical, and his invention was not
                developed in his native France. The center of innovation shifted
                to Great Britain. By 1784, William Murdoch had built a working
                model of a steam carriage in Redruth<sup>[11]</sup> and in 1801
                Richard Trevithick was running a full-sized vehicle on the roads
                in Camborne.

                During the 19th century, attempts were made to introduce
                steam-powered vehicles. Innovations such as hand brakes,
                multispeed transmissions, and better steering developed. Some
                successful vehicles provided mass transit until a backlash
                against these large vehicles resulted in the passage of
                legislation such as the UK Locomotives Act 1865, which required
                many self-propelled vehicles on public roads to be preceded by a
                man on foot waving a red flag and blowing a horn. This
                effectively halted road auto development in the United Kingdom
                for most of the 19th century; inventors and engineers shifted
                their efforts to improvements in railway locomotives. The law
                was not repealed until 1896, although the need for the red flag
                was removed in 1878.

                In 1816, a professor at Prague Polytechnic, Josef Bozek, built
                an oil-fired steam car.<sup>[12]</sup>: 27  Walter Hancock,
                builder and operator of London steam buses, in 1838 built a
                two-seated car phaeton.<sup>[12]</sup>: 27

                In 1867, Canadian jeweler Henry Seth Taylor demonstrated his
                four-wheeled "steam buggy" at the Stanstead Fair in Stanstead,
                Quebec and again the following year.<sup>[13]</sup> The basis of
                the buggy, which he began building in 1865, was a high-wheeled
                carriage with bracing to support a two-cylinder steam engine
                mounted on the floor.<sup>[14]</sup> In 1873, Frenchman Amédée
                Bollée built self-propelled steam road vehicles to transport
                groups of passengers.

                The first automobile suitable for use on existing wagon roads in
                the United States was a steam-powered vehicle invented in 1871
                by Dr. J.W. Carhart, a minister of the Methodist Episcopal
                Church, in Racine, Wisconsin.<sup>[15]</sup> It induced the
                state of Wisconsin in 1875 to offer a US$10,000 (equivalent to
                $266,485 in 2022) award to the first to produce a substitute for
                the use of horses and other animals. They stipulated that the
                vehicle would have to maintain an average speed of more than 8
                km/h (5 mph) over a 320 km (200 mi) course. The offer led to the
                first city-to-city automobile race in the United States,
                starting on 16 July 1878 in Green Bay, Wisconsin, and ending in
                Madison, Wisconsin, via Appleton, Oshkosh, Waupun, Watertown,
                Fort Atkinson, and Janesville. While seven vehicles were
                registered, only two started competing: the Green Bay and
                Oshkosh entries. The vehicle from Green Bay was faster but broke
                down before completing the race. The Oshkosh finished the 323 km
                (201 mi) course in 33 hours and 27 minutes and posted an average
                speed of 9.7 km/h (6 mph). In 1879, the legislature awarded half
                the prize.<sup>[16]</sup><sup>[17]</sup><sup>[18]</sup>

                    Steam-powered road vehicles, both cars and wagons, reached
                    the peak of their development in the early 1930s with
                    fast-steaming lightweight boilers and efficient engine
                    designs. Internal combustion engines also developed
                    considerably during World War I, becoming easier to operate
                    and more reliable. The development of the high-speed diesel
                    engine from 1930 began to replace them for wagons,
                    accelerated in the UK by tax changes making steam wagons
                    uneconomic overnight. Although a few designers continued to
                    advocate steam power, no significant developments in the
                    production of steam cars took place after Doble in 1931.

                    Whether steam cars will ever be reborn in later
                    technological eras remains to be seen. Magazines such as
                    Light Steam Power continued to describe them into the 1980s.
                    The 1950s saw interest in steam-turbine cars powered by
                    small nuclear reactors[19] (this was also true of aircraft).
                    Still, the fears about the dangers inherent in nuclear
                    fission technology soon killed these ideas.

              <p>
                In 1828, Ányos Jedlik, a Hungarian who invented an early
                electric motor, constructed a tiny model car powered by his new
                motor.[5] In 1834, Vermont blacksmith Thomas Davenport, the
                inventor of the first American DC electric motor, installed his
                motor in a small model car, which he operated on a short
                circular electrified track.[21] In 1835, Professor Sibrandus
                Stratingh of Groningen, the Netherlands and his assistant
                Christopher Becker created a small-scale electrical car, powered
                by non-rechargeable primary cells.[22] In 1838, Scotsman Robert
                Davidson built an electric locomotive that attained a speed of
                6.4 km/h (4 mph). In England, a patent was granted in 1840 for
                using tracks as conductors of electric current, and similar
                American patents were issued to Lilley and Colten in 1847.

                Sources point to different creations, such as the first electric
                car. Between 1832 and 1839 (the exact year is uncertain), Robert
                Anderson of Scotland invented a crude electric carriage powered
                by non-rechargeable primary cells. In November 1881, French
                inventor Gustave Trouvé demonstrated a working three-wheeled car
                powered by electricity at the International Exposition of
                Electricity.[23] English inventor Thomas Parker, who was
                responsible for innovations such as electrifying the London
                Underground, overhead tramways in Liverpool and Birmingham, and
                the smokeless fuel coalite, built an electric car in London in
                1884, using his own specially designed high-capacity
                rechargeable batteries.[24] However, some others regard the
                Flocken Elektrowagen of 1888 by German inventor Andreas Flocken
                as the first actual electric car.[20]

              <h4>20th Century</h4>
              <p>
                Electric cars enjoyed popularity between the late 19th century
                and the early 20th century when electricity was among the
                preferred methods for automobile propulsion. Advances in
                internal combustion technology, especially the electric starter,
                soon rendered this advantage moot; the greater range of gasoline
                cars, quicker refueling times, and growing petroleum
                infrastructure, along with the mass production of gasoline
                vehicles by companies such as the Ford Motor Company, which
                reduced prices of gasoline cars to less than half that of
                equivalent electric cars, led to a decline in the use of
                electric propulsion, effectively removing it from markets such
                as the US by the 1930s.

              <p>
                Increased concerns over the environmental impact of gasoline
                cars, higher gasoline prices, improvements in battery
                technology, and the prospect of peak oil have brought about
                renewed interest in electric cars, which are perceived to be
                more environmentally friendly and cheaper to maintain and run,
                despite high initial costs.
